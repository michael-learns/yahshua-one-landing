    q: "How much does YAHSHUA One Payroll cost?",
    a: "₱7,000 per month for up to 100 employees, with YAHSHUA HRIS included. Above 100 employees it is ₱60 per additional employee per month. There is a one-time ₱35,000 setup fee. Plan prices exclude VAT. Theo AI is optional, with pay-as-you-go credits from ₱100, and no credits are included in the plan.",
  },
  {
    q: "Does the plan include Theo AI credits?",
    a: "No. Theo AI is optional and runs on pay-as-you-go credits: 100 credits for ₱100, 500 for ₱450, or 2,000 for ₱1,600, VAT included. No credits are included in the plan, and Theo needs a credit balance above zero to answer.",
  },
  {
    q: "Do I need a subscription to use Theo?",
    a: "No. You can buy credits whenever you need them, and Theo works as long as your balance is above zero.",
  },
  {
    q: "Which YAHSHUA One modules can I buy today?",
    a: "YAHSHUA One Payroll is available today, with YAHSHUA HRIS included. Accounting, Tax and compliance, and ERP are coming soon and are not priced yet.",
  },
  {
    q: "What happens when I go over 100 employees?",
    a: "An additional ₱60 per employee per month is added on top of the ₱7,000 base rate. The calculator above shows your exact monthly cost for any headcount.",
  },
  {
    q: "Is there a setup fee?",
    a: "Yes. There is a one-time setup fee of ₱35,000, which covers full implementation, data migration, and dedicated onboarding training.",
  },
  {
    q: "Does YAHSHUA One Payroll come with YAHSHUA HRIS?",
    a: "Yes. Every plan includes YAHSHUA HRIS at no extra charge: employee management and 201 files, job posting and recruitment, leave, attendance and time tracking, DOLE compliance reports, and performance management.",
  },
  {
    q: "Is there a free trial?",
    a: "Yes. The trial is 30 days, long enough to run your first payroll cycle before you commit.",
  },
  {
    q: "Is VAT included in the plan price?",
    a: "No. Plan prices are VAT excluded. The 12% VAT is added to your invoice. Theo credit prices already include VAT.",
  },
  {
    q: "I'm an existing YAHSHUA client. Does my pricing change?",
    a: "No. Existing clients transition to YAHSHUA One with their current pricing intact. YAHSHUA One is the new platform foundation, not a rebrand with new fees.",
  },
  {
    q: "Is pricing in pesos?",
    a: "Always ₱. Billing, invoices, and all client communications are in Philippine pesos. No FX math, no USD rate surprises.",
  },
  {
    q: "What if I only need payroll?",
    a: "YAHSHUA One Payroll runs as a standalone product, without the broader ERP and accounting modules. YAHSHUA HRIS is included, so you can use as much or as little of it as you need.",
